    my personal config. 
    oh-my-zsh with enabled plugins autosuggestions, syntax highlighting and navigation tools.
    also docker autocomplete.
    tested in fedora and arch. also it may work in debian, sles and rhel-like distributions, but not autotested.
    after installing script will try to install modern apps:
    bat (replacement for cat)
    btop (replacement for htop)
    micro (replacement for nano)
    dust (replacement for du)
    duf (replacement for df)
    lsd (replacement for ls)
    gdu (replacement for ncdu)
    fd (not replacement but more fast file search than find)
    script will add aliases for this apps if apps exist in your distro.

    you need to configure your terminal fonts:
